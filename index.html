<p class="intro"> There are many misconceptions and misinformation surounding the Autistic community. One thing you must have in order to truly try to understand Autism is, empathy. 
For the neurotypical do not understand how it is to be neurodivergent. It is much like a different operating system. One that drives on Linux and one on Windows.

  "Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited
  and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term "spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity".</blockquote>

<h1>Autism and "masking"</h1>
<h4>Information on "unmasking" autism from Social psychologist Devon Price:</h4>
<div class="middle-container">"Roughly 2% of adults in the United States have Autism Spectrum Disorder–that's about 5.4 million people over the age of 18. And a lot of them go through their lives "masking"."</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/14/1092869514/unmasking-autism-more-inclusive-world">
"In addition to hiding from others, Price says masking is also a coping mechanism.
 "You know that if you show your discomfort with eye contact, people will find you untrustworthy and treat you very differently," he says.

Masking manifests itself in two ways: camouflage and compensation.

Camouflage includes behaviors like, "faking a smile, faking eye contact by looking in the middle of someone's forehead," Price says.

This is where compensation comes in. Price does this, for example, through scheduling ghost meetings on his calendar to give himself time to recharge.

"And that's really what most masked autistics end up having to do, because a lot of us receive social input, our whole lives, 
that there's something off about us," he says."

<h1>Adult Autism Services</h1>
<div class ="third-container">
<p>There are major differences in services available for children on the autism spectrum and adults on the autism spectrum.
It may be very difficult as an adult to find the neccesary services readily available.
Not all autistic people have the same symptoms and/or life experiences.   </p>


<blockquote cite="https://www.verywellhealth.com/services-for-adults-with-autism-4771552">
"One of the major differences relates to the appropriateness of programs and services for a person with autism spectrum disorder. 
In school, a child may have had access to autism-specific classes, therapies, and programs designed with the child's specific needs in mind. 
As an adult, they are more likely to be lumped in with other people with developmental disorders of all sorts.".</blockquote>
<br>

<p>There is a need for funding in order to conduct research and provide programs for adults on the spectrum. 
Life and coping skills are a necessity to have as a service in order for everyone on the spectrum to thrive. </p>
