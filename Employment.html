<p>Recent data that has come out displays adults with Autism are repeatedly underemployed. 
About 42% of young adults who are on the Autism spectrum have not worked for pay during their early 20's. 
Young adults on the Autism spectrum are unemployed and are not entering higher education, this accounts for about 66%. 
Despite the fact that most individuals on the spectrum have an above average IQ.
